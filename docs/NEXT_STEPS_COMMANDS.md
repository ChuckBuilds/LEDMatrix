# Next Steps - Run These Commands on Your Pi

## What's Happening Now

✅ Service is **enabled** and **active (running)**  
⏳ Currently **installing dependencies** (this is normal on first start)  
⏳ Should start Flask app once dependencies are installed

## Commands to Run Next

### 1. Wait a Minute for Dependencies to Install
The pip install process needs to complete first.

### 2. Check Current Status
```bash
sudo systemctl status ledmatrix-web
```

Look for the Tasks count - when it drops from 2 to 1, pip is done.

### 3. View the Logs to See What's Happening
```bash
sudo journalctl -u ledmatrix-web -f
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to exit when done watching.

You should eventually see:
- "Dependencies installed successfully"
- "Installing rgbmatrix module..."
- "Launching web interface v3: ..."
- Messages from Flask about starting the server

### 4. Check if Flask is Running on Port 5000
```bash
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :5000
```
or
```bash
sudo ss -tlnp | grep :5000
```

Should show Python listening on port 5000.

### 5. Test Access
Once the logs show Flask started, try accessing:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000
```

Or from your computer's browser:
```
http://<raspberry-pi-ip>:5000
```

## If It Gets Stuck

If after 2-3 minutes the dependencies are still installing and nothing happens:

```bash
# Stop the service
sudo systemctl stop ledmatrix-web

# Check what went wrong
sudo journalctl -u ledmatrix-web -n 100 --no-pager

# Try manual start to see errors directly
cd ~/LEDMatrix
python3 web_interface/start.py
```

## Expected Timeline

- **0-30 seconds**: Installing pip dependencies
- **30-60 seconds**: Installing rgbmatrix module  
- **60+ seconds**: Flask app should be running
- **Access**: http://<pi-ip>:5000 should work

## Success Indicators

✅ Logs show: "Starting LED Matrix Web Interface V3..."  
✅ Logs show: "Access the interface at: http://0.0.0.0:5000"  
✅ Port 5000 is listening  
✅ Web page loads in browser
